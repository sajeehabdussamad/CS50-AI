# CS50-AI

This repository contains projects and exercises completed as part of the CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course.

## Course Description

CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into key ideas such as informed search algorithms, probabilistic inference, and machine learning. Through hands-on projects, students get to implement and apply these algorithms to solve real-world problems.

## Projects

1. **Project 0: Maze** - Implement an AI to find a path from starting point to final point.
2. **Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe** - Implement an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects in this repository, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Clone this repository using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/CS50-AI.git


Then navigate to the project directory and run the desired project using Python:

for maze:
  cd CS50-AI/maze
  python3 maze.py maze$.txt
  Replace `$` with the 1, 2, 3 or 4.
for tictatoe:
  cd CS50-AI/tictactoe
  python3 runner.py
